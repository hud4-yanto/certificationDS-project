# Associate Data Scientist Certification Project
In this project I did classification using the Gender Classification dataset which you can see in the following <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset/data)> LINK.


This dataset contains 7 Features and a label column 
<or>
  <li>long_hair - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "long hair" and 0 is "not long hair".</li>
  <li>forehead_width_cm - This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead.</li>
  <li>forehead_height_cm - This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.</li>
  <li>nose_wide - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "wide nose" and 0 is "not wide nose".</li>
  <li>nose_long - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "Long nose" and 0 is "not long nose".</li>
  <li>lips_thin - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "thin lips" while 0 is "Not thin lips".</li>
  <li>distance_nose_to_lip_long - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "long distance between nose and lips" while 0 is "short distance between nose and lips".</li>
  <li>gender - This is either "Male" or "Female"</li>
</or>

Anyway, i create this project to finish certification test Associate Data Scientist by BNSP.
