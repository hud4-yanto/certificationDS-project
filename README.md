# Gender Classification Project
This project was created as part of my journey to complete Associate Data Scientist certification. The main goal of this project is to classify gender data using the Decision Tree algorithm. In this project I did classification using the Gender Classification dataset which you can see in the following <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset/data)> LINK.
<b>Project Objectives:</b>
<ol>
<li>To preprocess and explore the dataset to gain insights.</li>
<li>To implement and evaluate the Decision Tree algorithm for gender classification.</li>
</ol>
